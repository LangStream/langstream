/**
 * The purpose of this BeanELResolver is to disable methods invocations. By default, the EL
 * implementation allows for invoking JDK methods on beans like ${value.toString()}. We prefer to
 * disable such invocation for two reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Have more controls over the transformations API and provide utility methods instead under
 *       the "fn:" prefix. Otherwise, it hard to guarantee the availability of the API as the JDK
 *       evolves.
 *   <li>Security reasons as users may get access to internal methods that have unintended side
 *       effects.
 * </ul>
