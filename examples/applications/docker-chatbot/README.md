# Running your own Chat bot using docker

This sample application shows how to build a chat bot over the content of a website.
In this case you are going to crawler the LangStream.ai documentation website.

The Chat bot will be able to help you with LangStream.

In this example we are using [HerdDB](ps://github.com/diennea/herddb) as a vector database using the JDBC driver,
but you can use any Vector databases.


## Configure you OpenAI API Key

Export to the ENV the access key to OpenAI

```
export OPENAI_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

The default [secrets file](../../secrets/secrets.yaml) reads from the ENV. Check out the file to learn more about
the default settings, you can change them by exporting other ENV variables.

## Deploy the LangStream application in docker

The default docker runner starts Minio, Kafka and HerdDB, so you can run the application locally.

```
./bin/langstream docker run test -app examples/applications/docker-chatbot -i examples/instances/kafka-kubernetes.yaml -s examples/secrets/secrets.yaml
```


## Talk with the Chat bot using the CLI
Since the application opens a gateway, we can use the gateway API to send and consume messages.

```
./bin/langstream gateway chat test -cg bot-output -pg user-input -p sessionId=$(uuidgen)
```

Responses are streamed to the output-topic. If you want to inspect the history of the raw answers you can
consume from the log-topic using the llm-debug gateway:

```
./bin/langstream gateway consume test llm-debug
```
